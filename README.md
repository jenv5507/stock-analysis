# An Analysis of Stocks
 
**Overview of Project**
The purpose of this project was to help my client analyze the stock market over the last few years.  The current file has 12 stocks in it but would like to enhance his research and compare more stocks.  To do this, it required refactoring of the current VBA code provided so that the data runs efficiently and the output is executed quickly.

**Results**
After refactoring the code and running the program successfully, it was surprising to see the significant change year of year in the stocks as you can see in the images below.  For the ease of review, I have put 2017 and 2018 stocks side by side.
